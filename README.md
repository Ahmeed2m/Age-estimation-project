## Brief
The problem is Age Estimation for the popular **[UTKFace](https://susanqq.github.io/UTKFace/)** data-set.

The project has a gui interface for camera capturing and take the picture localize a face and give that face for out three implemented methods of estimating *KNN, SVM and CNN* trained from the previously mentioned data-set.
For now the project only runs on linux due to the pickle files of the models only readable from a linux enviroment.
